## Custom Short URL for your Slate Instance

Y'know what is kinda fun?   Short links.  Like turning a long URL link (https://engage.macalester.edu/register/?id=7c94151a-71b0-40e0-baa8-d804fa28c516&person=4140156b-cf7a-4f23-a69d-68b9f7b69606&howawesome=All%20of%20the%20awesome,%20don%27t%20get%20me%20started.) 
to something more like https://bit.ly/3G1YaKw.   Right?   Same result, one is way easier to read.  (And frankly looks more professional in your texting campaigns to your donors or constituents)

I think this is kinda fun, and it was super easy,
